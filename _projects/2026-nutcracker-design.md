The objective of this project was to design a nutcracker capable of cracking open a macadamia nut using a simple lever system.

According to Schrauf et al. (2008), the average load to rack a macademia nut is 222.18 kg. Therefore, the outward force of the macademia nut on the nutcracker was 2179.59 N. According to Priestoph, a nut distributor website from Germany, the average macadamia nut has a diameter of 28 mm. The average human grip strength is 36 kg, so the force exerted by a hypothetical human on the handle was 353.16 N.

 To do this, the mechanical advantage needed to successfully crack an average macademia nut had to be calculated, and then the length of the handles and distance between the nut and pin as a result. A simple free body diagram of the system was drawn, and the moment balance around the pin, denoted as "A", was calculated, resulting in a necessary mechanical advantage of 6.571. This revealed that the horizontal distance between the pin and the end of the handle had to be approximately 7 times the distance from the pin to the center of the nut.

 Following this, an arbitrary dimension for the distance from the pin to the nut's center was selected (50 mm), making the horizontal distance between the pin and the end of the handle 350 mm. Trigonometry was then used to find the handle length, 363.46 mm.

Calculations and a free body diagram can be seen here.

The dimensions calculated for the nutcracker seem mostly feasible and adequately account for slight variations in nut size and grip strength above and below the assumed averages, respectively. However, the setup is somewhat large, and a smaller nutcracker may be more practical, especially if the weight of the material, likely metal, used is considered. However, the longer handles make the system ore practical for individuals with lower grip strengths by producing a greater torque, making it valuable in certain scenarios.
